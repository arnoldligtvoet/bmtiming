This app is written for the World Human Powered Speed Challenge (WHPSC).

This event is held each year in Battle Mountain Nevada. The contestants race 
streamlined bicycles to high speeds over a 200m time trap. This app is designed
to manage and register the times for the sessions during the week. It can be
used completely off-line so there is no dependency on network connections. 

The results can be exported for sharing with others. 

Main functions:
- manage riders, teams and bicycles
- manage sessions and runs
- record times during sessions
- generate startersheets 
- show results
- caculate and show seeding order
